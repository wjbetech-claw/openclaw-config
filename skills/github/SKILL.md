# GitHub Skill

Use the `gh` CLI to interact with GitHub. Always specify `--repo owner/repo` when not in a git directory, or use URLs directly.

## Pull Requests

Check CI status on a PR:
```bash
gh pr checks 55 --repo owner/repo
```

List recent workflow runs:
```bash
gh run list --repo owner/repo --limit 10
```

View a run and see which steps failed:
```bash
gh run view <run-id> --repo owner/repo
```

## API for Advanced Queries

The `gh api` command is useful for accessing data not available through other subcommands.

Get PR with specific fields:
```bash
gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/55 --jq '.title, .state, .user.login'
```
